heres my current credit card stack for optimizing points in each category. i optimize for max dollar, derived from taking $\%\text{cb} \times \text{tpg}$. the tpg valuation represents the average value per point in cents based on [maximal value from transfer partners](https://thepointsguy.com/news/new-data-driven-valuations/). 

for example, in comparing citi custom cash vs amex gold in the grocery category: we can compare $5 \times 1.8$ vs $4 \times 2.0$. in this comparison, since $9.0 > 8.0$, citi custom cash is better than amex gold for grocery.
