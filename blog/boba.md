## disclaimers
- my sweetness control is default-1, (gong cha/kft 70%)
- some of these takes are extremely outdated (ordered chronologically but not dated)
- also forgot to log boba for like 4 months.
## my gotos
### ume mango mango with boba (fruity)
- i consistently order this drink from ume. to me, it has the perfect amount of chewables (mango, boba, sago) to snack on, with a wonderfully refreshing milk base to wash it down. my favourite part of this drink is it can be ordered with or without green tea, so i can order this drink at any time in the day.
### sunright boba milk tea (classic)
- imo, this is the best classic "milk tea". the ceylon tea has a deep and rich flavor, and the boba is extremely consistent. hard to go wrong with this classic.
### tp tea strawberry matcha latte (matcha)
- imo, tp tea has a great matcha -- absent of that unfavorable chalky mouth feel in a lot of matchas.
