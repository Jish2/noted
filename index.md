%% do the animated swap thing %%

hi/nihao/hola, i'm josh goon!

in late september 2024, i dropped out of [uiuc](https://illinois.edu/) to join [tesla](https://www.tesla.com/).

im most interested in productivity, currently focusing on developer experience and tooling.

most recently, ive been diving into distributed systems. i love starting and never finishing books like ddia, grokking, and [engineering blogs](https://github.com/Jish2/system-design/?tab=readme-ov-file#engineering-blogs).

outside of work, you can catch me drinking [[boba|bobaðŸ§‹]] and [boulderingðŸ—¿](#)

i take great pride in my [[setup|workflow and setup]] and also love documenting everything ive ever done in [guides](/guides). this website is also a collection of my [[notes]]. feel free to take a look around, or checkout the [source code](https://github.com/Jish2/noted)!
