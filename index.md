hey, i'm //josh goon//!

early in 2024 at //19//, i dropped out of //icon[uiuc.png]// [uiuc](https://illinois.edu/) to join //icon[tesla.svg]// [tesla](https://www.tesla.com/).

im super interested in //productivity//, currently focusing on //developer experience// and //tooling//.

%% insert image of license, inline image -> hover to blow up (amazon style) %%

most recently, ive been diving into //distributed systems//. i love starting and never finishing books like //icon[ddia.jpg]// [ddia, grokking](https://github.com/Jish2/system-design/?tab=readme-ov-file#books), and [engineering blogs](https://github.com/Jish2/system-design/?tab=readme-ov-file#engineering-blogs).

outside of work, you can catch me //drinking boba//ðŸ§‹ and //bouldering//ðŸ—¿

i take great pride in my [[setup|workflow and setup]] and also love documenting things i do in [blog](/blog). this website is also a collection of my [[notes]]. feel free to take a look around, or checkout the [source](https://github.com/Jish2/noted)!
