### disclaimers
my sweetness control is standard - 1, (gong cha/kft 70%)
### my rankings
tptea 8.9
mr sun 7.3 gas homemade balls
sunright 8.4 - ceylon cheese - BOBA is GAS
teatop 5.0 - by church 
ume 7.6 - mango sago pretty good
moon tea - 
tapioca express - mangonada is attrocious , texture really icy
xing fu tang - really squishy boba, 0 chew, sweetness is low
feng cha - probably the closest to best boba I’ve had — crème brûlée is good runs sweet (even at 50%)
boba guys - tie guan yin oolong , boba is tiny but pretty good sweetness is low 
happy lemon 5.4 - roasted okinawa — runs really sweet, got 75% and was too sweet, boba sucks - has a bite to it, not a good chewy, tasted undercooked.
3catea - 8.0 ube mochi really good but so overpriced
ume - oolong mochi, boba was too chewy, oolong flavor too strong
yifang 8.5 - mango sago, really good (no boba)
ume strawberry matcha - 7.2 mochi didn’t go well with it
tptea 8.4 - tie guan yin milk tea 
tenren 7.8 - good boba 8.5 softness but not quite to tea. flavor is ok tastes a little artificial 
odd one oht  - champion with winter melon silk boba 
xing fu tang - the original - boba was much better, way too sweet, boba was chewier 
feng cha - 8.5 mango auliete boba is good but 50% ran a little sweet so
pekoe & tisane - 3.0 - abg boba, amazing medicine aftertaste
7leaves - 7.0 mung bean, was a unique flavor to me
3catea 8.0 - avomango runs a little sour but is a acquired taste
