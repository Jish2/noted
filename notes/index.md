%% do the animated swap thing %%
hi/nihao/hola, i'm josh goon!

in late september 2024, i dropped out of [uiuc](https://illinois.edu/) to join [tesla](https://www.tesla.com/).

im obsessed with developer experience and tooling -- im all about productivity :)

%% insert image of license %%

i am interested in distributed systems, i love starting and never finishing books like ddia, grokking, and [engineering blogs](https://github.com/Jish2/system-design/?tab=readme-ov-file#engineering-blogs).

outside of work, i love [[boba]] and [bouldering]()

i take great pride in my [[setup|workflow and setup]] and also love documenting everything i've ever done in [guides](/guides). this website is also a collection of my [[notes]]. feel free to take a look around, or checkout the [source code](https://github.com/Jish2/noted)!
